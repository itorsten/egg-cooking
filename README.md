# egg-cooking

Simulate the cooking of an egg.

Open `index.html` in a web browser and configure:

- **Total time** for the simulation.
- **Water temperature profile**: choose a constant temperature or specify a time
  schedule using pairs of `time,temperature` values.

The app solves a simple placeholder ODE model for yolk and albumen
temperatures and their cooking degrees. After running, two charts display the
temperatures and cooking progression over time.

Note: This app is vibe-coded.
